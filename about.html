	<p>My name is Arjun Shanker.  I am currently living in Denver, Colorado. </p>
	<p>I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering, in May of 2015. I have worked for a couple of very large companies, on their mobile apps, and I've found the most fun has been working on Android Development. </p>
	<p>I have a lot of passion for quality, and my goal is to make sure that whatever I produce is the best possible thing I could have written. The goal is to do my best, find what's wrong with it and improve from it.</p>
