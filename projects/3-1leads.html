	<h1>3-1Leads.com</h1>
	<p>In hockey, a 3-1 lead is commonly regarded as the worst lead to have in a game or series. This extends to other sports like <a class="pinklink" href="http://www.nba.com/playoffs/2016/finals/">basketball</a> or <a class="pinklink" href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/207938228/chicago-cubs-win-2016-world-series/">baseball</a>, and some even reference the <a class="pinklink" href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-1.htm">bible</a>. I was curious what the actual statistics were like for hockey, so I put this together to try and aggregate that data.</p>
    <p>I accidentally let the domain lapse, so I no longer have it. I will update this with a link to the new domain when I get one.</p>
