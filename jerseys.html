	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>If you're on my site, you probably know that I really enjoy hockey! When I graduated from MSOE, I moved to Cleveland, and at that point I started following hockey again with some of my newfound free time. Obviously I didn't expect to buy a ton of jerseys, but there were <i>several</i> specialty jersey nights for the Cleveland Monsters, and the replicas for sale were a lot more affordable than most jerseys tend to be, and then all of a sudden here we are.</p>
  <p>Feel free to peruse my collection of jerseys - and let me know which one is your favorite lol</p>
