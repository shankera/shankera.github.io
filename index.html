	<p>My name is Arjun Shanker. This site was originally how I learned and familiarized myself with web development to some degree. At this point I've basically just been keeping it up to date as a quick reference to my resume and work experience. When I've felt particularly inspired about something that has frustrated me, I'll write a blog post to try and find a good solution. If you have any comments or feedback, feel free to contact me. If you would like to know more about me or a project that I am working on, feel free to contact me. Really, contact me about anything.</p>
